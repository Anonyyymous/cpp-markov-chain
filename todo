    make regurgitate's i start at [word count] of input, and make soft limit actually work
    let us add training data to a model again
4) add soft cutoff for new sentences, and hard limit for words
    implement this into HTTP 
5) HTTP server
    1) make server infinite?
    2) add word count to response?
    4) maybe change how the toJson works
6) Documentation
7) Tests
    1) Python script that requests it and checks it against another string from a given training data
    2) program that gives inputs to train/save a file, then run it?
    3) then get it from the api via python
